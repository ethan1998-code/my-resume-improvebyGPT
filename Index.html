        <h2>Ethan Neuman</h2>
        <p>
          I have experience serving in the Israeli army's Unit 8200 and have a
          successful background in business. As a former group leader and
          entrepreneur, I have a passion for taking on new challenges and now, I
          am actively seeking to return to a hands-on role (Senior Analyst,
          Office of the CEO). I am highly motivated and determined to provide
          the greatest value possible in all my endeavors.
